# Flutter-Based-Taxi-app
Flutter Based Two Taxi apps.

The driver app would enable taxi drivers to receive ride requests, navigate to pick up locations, and complete rides. It would include features such as real-time GPS tracking, push notifications, trip history, and payment integration. The app would also provide drivers with information about the rider, including their name, location, and destination.

The rider app, on the other hand, would allow users to request rides, track their driver's location, and pay for rides. It would include features such as GPS tracking, ride history, and real-time driver updates. The app would also provide riders with information about their driver, including their name, photo, and rating.


To import a Flutter project from GitHub into Android Studio, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: First, you need to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. You can do this using the command line or through the GitHub Desktop application.

    Open Android Studio: Launch Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen.

    Select the project directory: Navigate to the location where you cloned the repository and select the project directory. The project should have a 'pubspec.yaml' file in the root directory.

    Wait for Gradle to build: Android Studio will take some time to build the Gradle files for the project. This process may take a few minutes depending on the size of the project.

    Run the project: Once the Gradle build is complete, you can run the project by clicking the 'run' button in the toolbar or by selecting 'Run' from the 'Run' menu.

    Install missing dependencies: If Android Studio prompts you to install missing dependencies, follow the instructions provided to install them.

That's it! Your Flutter project should now be imported into Android Studio and ready to run.
